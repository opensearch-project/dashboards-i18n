## Developer guide

We're glad you're here. i18n-plugin is a community driven plugin for localization. To use it, here's what you need to do.

### Forking and Cloning

Fork this repository on GitHub, and clone locally with `git clone`.

### Environment Setup

1. Download OpenSearch. You could clone the [OpenSearch repo](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch.git), use [docker](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/install/docker/) or [artifact](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/install/tar/). Make sure the version matches the OpenSearch Dashboards version.
2. Setup the environment to run OpenSearch Dashboards. You will need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md), and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) in your environment to properly pull down dependencies to build and bootstrap.
3. Download the OpenSearch-Dashboards source code.

   See the [OpenSearch Dashboards developer guide](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for more instructions on setting up your development environment.

4. Change your node version to the version specified in `.node-version` inside the OpenSearch-Dashboards root directory.
5. cd into the `plugins` directory of the OpenSearch-Dashboards source code directory. Clone [i18n-plugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/i18n-plugin.git) into the `plugins` directory. Ultimately, your directory structure should look like this:

```md
.
├── OpenSearch-Dashboards
│   └── plugins
│       └── i18n-plugin
```
6. Config localization in i18n-plugin. Add a locale json file in `translations` directory of the i18n-plugin. Specify the path in `.i18nrc.json`. For example, if the locale json file you added is called `zh-CN.json`, the path should be `"translations": ["translations/zh-CN.json"`.
7. Config localization in OpenSearch Dashboards. cd into the `config` directory of the OpenSearch-Dashboards source code directory. Add `i18n.locale: "{your locale}"` in `opensearch_dashboards.yml` file.
8. Run `yarn osd bootstrap` under `Opensearch-Dashboards`.

### Run

- `yarn start`

  - Starts OpenSearch-Dashboards and includes this plugin. A localized OpenSearch-Dashboards will be available on `localhost:5601`.
  - Please run in the OpenSearch-Dashboards root directory
  - You must have OpenSearch running.

### Example
  
1. Setup environment. Please refer to [Environment Setup](#environment-setup).
2. Config localization in i18n-plugin. Add the following example `zh-CN.json` file in `translations` directory. In `.i18nrc.json`, add the path `"translations": ["translations/zh-CN.json"`.

3. Config localization in OpenSearch Dashboards. Add `i18n.locale: "zh-CN"` in `opensearch_dashboards.yml` file.
4. Run OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards. Verify the login and home pages are correctly translated.

### New locale

Currently, we support en/en-US (English), es/es-LA (Spanish), fr/fr-FR (French), de/de-DE (German), ja/ja-JP (Japanese), ko/ko-KR (Korean), zh/zh-CN (Chinese). If your locale is not in it, please open an issue in OpenSearch Dashboards.

### Contribute

Are you ready to contribute? You could send a PR to upload a new locale file or add up the existing locale. You could also contribute by opening an issue for any translation errors or just sharing some thoughts.
